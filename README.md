# Feedback System - Frontend

This is the front-end code for the soon to be launched *Ager* *"Feedback System"*.

## Getting Started

There isn't really anything general here, but you can check out how we do data
fetching using react hooks or how the way we interface with Apollo.

You can have a look around in the way we structure our front end projects and at
the mess that our work leaves.


### Installing

Before running locally on a machine, hope that our API servers are running.
If this website [Official Website](https://feedback.agerspace.com) is online,
our servers are running.

```
npm install
```

Should install all necessary npm modules, then you can either run locally or
deploy. 

## Running tests

Due to React strict mode interference, there can be no unused imports in the
project, make sure that doesn't happen. 

## Deployment

This front-end is currently deployed via *"netlify"*
We deploy our front-ends either ourselves or use amazing services like
*"vercel"* or *"netlify"*, depending on purpose.
